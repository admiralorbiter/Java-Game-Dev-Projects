# Java-Game-Dev-Projects
Older game dev projects I have worked on. Most are small proof of concepts of mechanics. Each has a small description and preview of what I worked on.

## Mistborn Proof of Concept

This is a small proof of concept with several mechanics from the fantasy series Mistborn.

Small 2-D Platformer built in pure java. 

Mechanics:
* Collision
* Gravity
* Jumping/Movement

## Checkers - Incomplete

I was attempting to creating a small checkers game in order to explore game ai. 
Unfortunately, I ended up abandoning the project pretty early.
