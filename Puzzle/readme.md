# Puzzle - Matching Game

I wanted to create a very simple game in pure java in order to understand the basics of a gameplay loop and basic game engine.

This is a very simple memory matching game. The cards are flipped over and the player has to match the two cards.

**Note:** I'm aware there is a bug where it doesn't show the second card when click on it.
